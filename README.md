# StarCrusader

Star Crusader is an Asteroid style game built in python 3.0 using pygame. The goal is to collect as much treasure as you can without running out of fuel or dying. Upon starting the game, asteroids and planets will randomly generate around the player. The player must avoid the asteroids and land on planets to get fuel and collect treasure. Planets and randomly generated resource-filled asteroids contain fuel/health/energy to aid the player.
